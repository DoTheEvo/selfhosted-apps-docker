# Purpose & Overview

Ubiquiti managment software for **wifi** access points and other ubiquiti hardware.<br>

* [Official site](https://www.ui.com/software/)
* [linuxserver github](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-unifi-network-application)

UniFi is a web based managment software for Ubiquiti devices.</br>
It is written in Java, utilizing the Spring Framework
and using MongoDB as a database.<br>
Docker image used here is provided by
[linuxserver.io](https://www.linuxserver.io/)

# Migration from UniFi Controller

* Do the manual **backup** of your old instance, through webgui settings.
* Down the old container.
* Spin the new stuff
* Restore the backup

<summary>Extra Info & Rant</summary>
<br>

Previously called [UniFi Controller](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-unifi-controller)

Ubiquiti morons decided to change the name to UniFi Network Application.
Then also tried to go for name UniFi Network Server with a claim that its for 
selfhosted version. In docs and even in downloads they mostly use the `application`.<br>
Though love that inside the webgui version its just `Network 8.0.28`

With this name change, linuxserver.io also changed the deployment so that
mongo database is now a separate container.<br>
Would not be a big issue, if mongo would not [suck big time](https://github.com/docker-library/mongo/issues/174)
at initiating databases in new deployments, making it unnecessary complicated.
Or if linuxserver.io could make a decision and write
[cleaner instructions](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-unifi-network-application/issues/13)
instead of trying to teach to fish.<br>
Also linuxserver.io official stance is to use older version of mongo v3.6 - v4.4<br>
Reports are that raspberry pi 4 users need to go for that v3.6

Big help to get this going cleanly was [this repo](https://github.com/GiuseppeGalilei/Ubiquiti-Tips-and-Tricks),
from [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ubiquiti/comments/18stenb/unifi_network_application_easy_docker_deployment/)
reddit post.<br>
First time Ive seen `configs` used in compose this way, saved a bother of doing
a separate mounting of `mongo-init.js`, that for some reason did not work for me.
Here it is improved a bit by using variables, so stuff can be set just in `.env`

# Files and directory structure

```
/home/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ~/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ docker/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ unifi/
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üóÅ mongo_db_data/
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üóÅ unifi_data/
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üóã .env
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üóã docker-compose.yml
```

* `mongo_db_data/` - database data 
* `unifi_data/` - unifi configuration and other data
* `.env` - a file containing environment variables for docker compose
* `docker-compose.yml` - a docker compose file, telling docker
  how to run the containers

You only need to provide the files.</br>
The directory is created by docker compose on the first run.

# docker-compose

Compose should not need any changes, theres `.env` file for that.

Worth noting is use of [configs](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/08-configs/)
to bypass the need for separate `mongo-init.js` file.<br>
The use comes from [this repo](https://github.com/GiuseppeGalilei/Ubiquiti-Tips-and-Tricks).

# Adoption

![override_pic](https://i.imgur.com/VyCqaCp.png)

The controller might see your APs during initial setup,
but it can not adopt them before you set your docker host IP
as `Override Inform Host`.

* **Inform Host** check the **Override** checbox<br>
  *Settings > System > Advanced*<br>
* enter docker-host IP
* adopt devices

# Some Settings

* **Disable "Connects high performance clients to 5 GHz only"**<br>
  *Old interface > Settings > Wireless Networks > Edit > Advanced Options*<br>
  When enabled it forces devices to ignore 2.4GHz which obviously causes problems at range. 
  Fucking monstrous stupidity to be default on,
  but I guess globaly they have power to cleanup 2.4GHz a bit.
* **802.11 DTIM Period - sets to 3**<br>
  *Settings > Wifi > Edit > Advanced*<br>
  For [apple devices](https://www.sniffwifi.com/2016/05/go-to-sleep-go-to-sleep-go-to-sleep.html)<br>

# Migration

* old controller - settings - system - somewhere backup - just settings - you get a `unf` file
* new controller - on the first run theres an option to restore from backup, pick the file
* done

# Config autobackup

config files should be in `~/unifi/unifi_data/data/backup`

# Encountered issues

Because I had `./mongo_db_data:/data` as bind mount
instead of `./mongo_db_data:/data/db`, there was an issue.
Everything worked fine for weeks, even shutdown of the docker host
or sudden power outage... but on downing of the container and then upping,
login would stop working with the notice "invalid username and/or password".

# Update

Manual image update:

- `docker-compose pull`</br>
- `docker-compose up -d`</br>
- `docker image prune`
