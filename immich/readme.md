# Purpose & Overview

 Selfhosted google photos alternative.

* [Official site](https://immich.app/)
* [Github](https://github.com/immich-app/immich)

Immich is a selfhosted photo and video management solution,
written mostly in javascript with Dart for android/ios apps
and postgress for the database. There is some python for machine learning.

# Files and directory structure

```
/home/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ~/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ docker/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ immich/
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üóÅ library/
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üóÅ postgress/
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üóã .env
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üóã compose.yml
```

* `library` - all the photos and videos uploaded
* `postgress` - the database data, metadata
* `.env` - a file containing environment variables for docker compose
* `compose.yml` - a docker compose file, telling docker how to run the containers

Only the two files are required. The directories are created on the first run.

# compose

[compose](https://github.com/immich-app/immich/tree/main/docker) on github.

Immich has prepared compose file for the deployment.<br>
I usually edit them to fit the way I do things,
but here I made only two changes - added network stuff and made database container
pull env values from the .env file.

`docker-compose.yml`
```yml

# WARNING: To install Immich, follow our guide: https://immich.app/docs/install/docker-compose

# Make sure to use the docker-compose.yml of the current release:

**All containers must be on the same network**.</br>
Which is named in the `.env` file.</br>
If one does not exist yet: `docker network create caddy_net`

# Reverse proxy

Caddy v2 is used, details
[here](https://github.com/DoTheEvo/selfhosted-apps-docker/tree/master/caddy_v2).</br>

Click through the initial setup.
Use a real email as it will be used for notifications and stuff.

# Email notifications setup

* Admin account > right top corner - Administration > Settings > Notifications
* Email
  * Host: smtp-relay.brevo.com
  * Port: 587
  * Username: \<email used for brevo registration\>
  * Password: \<generated smtp long key\>
  * From address: if on brevo you verified domain than whatevers there
  * Test - an email will be send to current account email address

# Trouble shooting


# Update

Manual image update:

- `docker-compose pull`</br>
- `docker-compose up -d`</br>
- `docker image prune`

It is **strongly recommended** to now add current **tags** to the images in the compose.<br>
Tags will allow you to easily return to a working state if an update goes wrong.
