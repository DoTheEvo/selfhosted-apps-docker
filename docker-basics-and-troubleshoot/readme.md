# Overview

**Docker** is a container technology that uses the hosts kernel while putting the userland applications into a sandbox.
It is much more lightweight than a full-fledged virtual machine, but can only run stuff that can run on host.

**Compose** is a Docker tool that allows defining containers using a YAML file and run them with a single command.

The purpose of docker and docker-compose is either development or deployment.<br>
Most of the stuff around here is about deployment, how to deploy others people work<br>
