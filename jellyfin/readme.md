Jellyfin if a free media system, an alternative to proprietary Plex.<br>
The core server side is written in C#, web client in Javascript,
and a number of other clients written in various languages and frameworks.

Starting point for me was [this viggy96 repo](https://github.com/viggy96/container_config)

* `/mnt/bigdisk/...` - a mounted media storage share
* `jellyfin-cache/` - cache 
* `jellyfin-config/` - configuration 
* `transcodes/` - transcoded video storage
* `.env` - a file containing environment variables for docker compose
* `docker-compose.yml` - a docker compose file, telling docker how to run the containers
* `jellyfin-backup-script.sh` - a backup script if you want it

You only need to provide the files.</br>
The directories are created by docker compose on the first run.

# docker-compose

The media are mounted in read only mode.

`docker-compose.yml`
```yml
services:

  jellyfin:
    image: jellyfin/jellyfin:latest
    container_name: jellyfin
    hostname: jellyfin
    restart: unless-stopped
    env_file: .env
    devices:
      - /dev/dri
    volumes:

`.env`
```bash
# GENERAL
MY_DOMAIN=example.com
DOCKER_MY_NETWORK=caddy_net
TZ=Europe/Bratislava
```

**All containers must be on the same network**.</br>
Which is named in the `.env` file.</br>
If one does not exist yet: `docker network create caddy_net`

# Reverse proxy

Caddy is used, details
[here](https://github.com/DoTheEvo/selfhosted-apps-docker/tree/master/caddy_v2).</br>

`Caddyfile`
```
jellyfin.{$MY_DOMAIN} {
    reverse_proxy jellyfin:8096
}

# First run

# Specifics of my setup

* no long term use yet
* no gpu, so no experience with hw transcoding
* media files are stored and shared on trunas scale VM
 and mounted directly on the docker host using [systemd mounts](https://forum.manjaro.org/t/root-tip-systemd-mount-unit-samples/1191),
 instead of fstab or autofs.

  `/etc/systemd/system/mnt-bigdisk.mount`
  ```ini
  [Unit]
  Description=12TB truenas mount

  [Mount]
  What=//10.0.19.19/Dataset-01
  Where=/mnt/bigdisk
  Type=cifs
  Options=ro,username=ja,password=qq,file_mode=0700,dir_mode=0700,uid=1000

  `/etc/systemd/system/mnt-bigdisk.automount`

  [Automount]

  to automount on boot - `sudo systemctl start mnt-bigdisk.automount`

# Troubleshooting


![error-pic](https://i.imgur.com/KQhmZTQ.png)

*We're unable to connect to the selected server right now. Please ensure it is running and try again.*

If you encounter this, 
try open the url in browsers private window.

If it works then clear the cookies in your browser.


# Update

Manual image update:

- `docker-compose pull`</br>
- `docker-compose up -d`</br>
- `docker image prune`

# Backup and restore

#### Backup

Using [borg](https://github.com/DoTheEvo/selfhosted-apps-docker/tree/master/borg_backup)
that makes daily snapshot of the entire directory.
  
#### Restore

* down the bookstack containers `docker-compose down`</br>
* delete the entire bookstack directory</br>
* from the backup copy back the bookstack directory</br>
* start the containers `docker-compose up -d`

# Backup of just user data

dont care
